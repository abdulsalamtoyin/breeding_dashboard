# Install Python packages
pip install -r requirements_macos.txt

# Download AI model (choose based on your Mac)
ollama pull llama3.2:1b  # For 8GB+ RAM
# or
ollama pull llama3.2:3b  # For 16GB+ RAM

# Run the app
streamlit run app.py
```

## 🖥️ MacBook-Specific Optimizations

### Apple Silicon (M1/M2/M3) Macs
Your Mac is **perfect** for AI! Here's why:
- **Neural Engine** accelerates AI computations
- **Unified memory** allows larger models
- **Energy efficient** - models run fast with great battery life
- **Metal GPU** provides additional acceleration

**Recommended setup for Apple Silicon:**
```bash
# Fast and efficient (1GB model)
ollama pull llama3.2:1b

# Better responses (2GB model) - recommended for 16GB+ RAM
ollama pull llama3.2:3b

# High performance (4GB model) - for 24GB+ RAM
ollama pull llama3.2:7b
```

### Intel Macs
Still great for local AI! Intel Macs run the models efficiently:
- Works with all models
- May be slightly slower than Apple Silicon
- Still much faster than cloud APIs for many queries

**Recommended setup for Intel:**
```bash
# Best balance of speed and quality
ollama pull llama3.2:1b
```

## 💾 Memory Recommendations

### 8GB MacBook
```bash
ollama pull llama3.2:1b  # Perfect fit
```
- Fast responses
- Great for most breeding questions
- Leaves plenty of RAM for other apps

### 16GB MacBook
```bash
ollama pull llama3.2:3b  # Recommended
```
- Excellent response quality
- Handles complex breeding analysis
- Still efficient memory usage

### 24GB+ MacBook
```bash
ollama pull llama3.2:7b  # Best experience
```
- Highest quality responses
- Handles the most complex questions
- Professional-grade AI analysis

## 🛠️ macOS-Specific Setup Steps

### Step 1: Install Ollama
**Method 1 - Direct install (recommended):**
```bash
curl -fsSL https://ollama.ai/install.sh | sh
```

**Method 2 - Homebrew (if you use it):**
```bash
brew install ollama
```

**Method 3 - Manual download:**
1. Go to https://ollama.ai/download
2. Download for macOS
3. Drag to Applications folder

### Step 2: Install Python Dependencies
```bash
# Make sure you're in your project directory
cd breeding-dashboard

# Install requirements
pip install -r requirements_macos.txt
```

### Step 3: Start Ollama
```bash
# Start Ollama service
ollama serve

# In a new terminal tab, download a model
ollama pull llama3.2:1b
```

### Step 4: Test Everything
```bash
# Test Ollama
ollama list

# Test the app
streamlit run app.py
```

## 🔧 macOS Troubleshooting

### Common macOS Issues

**"Command not found: ollama"**
```bash
# Add to your shell profile (zsh is default on modern macOS)
echo 'export PATH="/usr/local/bin:$PATH"' >> ~/.zshrc
source ~/.zshrc

# For Apple Silicon, also check:
echo 'export PATH="/opt/homebrew/bin:$PATH"' >> ~/.zshrc
```

**"Permission denied" errors**
```bash
# Fix Python package permissions
pip install --user -r requirements_macos.txt
```

**"Port already in use"**
```bash
# Kill existing Ollama processes
pkill ollama

# Restart Ollama
ollama serve
```

**Slow model download**
```bash
# macOS may have network throttling
# Try downloading during off-peak hours
# Or use a different model:
ollama pull llama3.2:1b  # Smaller, faster download
```

### macOS-Specific Tips

**Terminal Setup:**
- Use the built-in Terminal app
- Or try iTerm2 for better experience
- Make sure you're using zsh (default shell)

**Performance Monitoring:**
```bash
# Check system resources
top -o cpu

# Monitor Ollama specifically
ps aux | grep ollama
```

**Battery Life:**
- AI models use CPU/GPU but are efficient on Apple Silicon
- First model load uses more power
- Subsequent queries are very efficient
- Your MacBook will handle this easily!
